I wanted a simple "Pass a hat around and draw a name from it" app, but couldn't find one that I liked.

This app lets you:

- Make a hat.
- Put names in it.
- Take turns drawing names from the hat.
- It's random.
- No need for emailing, just pass the generated links around to the expected recepients.
- Doesn't track you.

tl;dr This is a thin UI APP, using tokens to maintain the state of the "hat". So feel free to use it without worry of someone tracking you and your friends.
